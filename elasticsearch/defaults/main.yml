# To prevent data loss, it is vital to configure the this setting, so that
# each master-eligible node knows the minimum number of master-eligible nodes
# that must be visible in order to form a cluster.
# Example: If there are three master-eligible nodes, then minimum master nodes
# should be set to (3 / 2) + 1 or 2.
